                    surprise. The exixstence of cars has kept me motivated in
                    life as I have very big plans in the future on what cars I
                    shall acquire and take care of. Here is my car in this
                    photo (yes I know it's not fast) but it does the job of
                    getting me to school, allowing me to write this
                    sentence as we speak! Try to guess what it is without Googling it.</p>

                <p class="like_text">I remember the day I was first introduced to video games.
                    My earliest memory must have been when I got my first game console, the Nintendo Gamecube
                    and a copy of Mario Kart Dash. Since then I always had a secpial place in my heart for
                    Nintendo even if their current selection is lacking. PC Gaming has also been a long
                    time hobby with games such as SuperTux or FPS shooters such as Fortnite.

                    isn't it? Lucky for me, drawing is something I particulary enjoy doing.
                    I've especially been a fan of drawing comic strips with my main characters
                    being cartoon penguins. All of my comics are intended to be really funny and
                    that they are! I hope to one day make something big out of this as I never
                    get bored of drawing them.

                    it will make your head spin. Me personally, I enjoy building, repairing and messing
                    around with software as a pass time for fun. I also collect many different comptuers old
                    and new in order to have a variety of hardware and operating systems to work with. Although
                    i'll be honest, Windows makes me very mad sometimes..

                    I tend to follow online recipies or try my own things and more often than not I get 
                    great results for some delicious foods. In this photo you see a pan pizza which turned
                    out amazing, maybe better than Domino's.

            <p>Now that you know what kind of stuff I like, you have a better

                upon most of my hobbies over many years to the point that you can
                pretty much call me a pro at this point. To get a good understanding on
