                        Wether you need desings on paper or on digital, I got you
                        covered!
                        I have experience with pencil on paper drawing as well as digital on a tablet using programs
                        such as
                        Photoshop and Krita. Although most of my illustrations may appear simple, I can convey the right
                        emotions in the things I create therefor making my skills especially useful in storyboarding,
                        screnplay,
                        comic strips and character designs.

                    <p>
                        I have a lot of exeperience with troubleshooting hardware and software problems on a computer.
                        While I am more specialized in Windows, I have also worked with Apple Mac computers. From
                        diagnosing
                        viruses and removing them, to fixing software issues and hardware problems, I will definitely
                        fix
                        your problem or provide solutions to the least.

                    <p class="skills_choice">Video Editor</p>
                    <p>
                        Starting off with Movie Maker and then moving onto VSDC, I have made a lot of projects
                        with video editing which range from memes to professional film content. I have access to
                        a lot of visual FX and features which allow me to make some awesome videos.

                    <p>
                        Like what you see? I may be a beginner at web design and coding on it's own, but I have a tendancy
                        to learn really quickly. Every moment i'm working on this website I am contributing to my own skills
                        to improve and go beyond my abilities. Web design involves a healthy mix of coding and designing which
                        is very complicated if you think about it, that is why I always plan before excecuting.

                    <p>
                        Cars are just so awesome as I've mentionned on my interests page. But I do indeed know enough about them
                        and their many problems with certain brands. It's always good to do research on a vehicle before making the
                        decision to purchase it. But with my knowledge I help others guide them to the right choices!

                    <p>
                        The amount of music keyboards and other devices I own is crazy. I sucessfully created one song so far which
                        may not seem like much but I do plan on creating some more music. I tend to go for a techno genre as
                        that's the sort of music I enjoy. I can also work with other music genres as well.
